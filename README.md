This repo covers bulding a logistic regression classifier to recognize cats. The notebook will include all the steps on how to do this with a Neural Network mindset. Vectorization is the core concept in the model development.

Notebook Summary:

  1) Build the general architecture of a learning algorithm, including:
        Initializing parameters
        Calculating the cost function and its gradient
        Using an optimization algorithm (gradient descent)
  2) Gather all three functions above into a main model function, in the right order.
